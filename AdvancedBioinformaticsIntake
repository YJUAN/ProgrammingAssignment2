# Assignment 1:
Produce a plot or table of the outcomes of the formula: y=2 * cos(x), with x ranging from -10 to 10, with increments of 1.
The program should produce a line/dot plot directly, or a data table containing an x and a y column.

#I used R Programming to produce a line plot.
x<- c(-10:10)

y<- 2*cos(x)

plot(x,y,type="l")
